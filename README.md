# Question №1:
Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome?

# Answer to the question №1:

My project consists of several files folders:
- routes - modules in this folder describes routing for blog app;
- validation - modules in this folder describes validation rules for every user request;
- tests - this folder contains one file that can be used to run test for every possible request.

Starting points are **'server.js'** file or **'tests\testRequests.js'**.
- First one can be used to run a server and make requests;
- Second one can be used to run a server and perform test which perform requests automatically.
